# Kazi-Nyuki: Solar-Powered AI for Precision Agriculture

A concept for the Green Wells Students Techathon 2025.

---

## My Inspiration
My inspiration came from a startling realization: there is a massive, hidden energy crisis happening in our fields. I saw that every year, Kenyan farmers invest enormous energy—diesel for tractors, electricity for irrigation—to grow crops, but a significant portion of this energy is wasted when crops fail due to poor pollination.

As a problem-solver passionate about "Code for Purpose," I was inspired to tackle this real-world energy challenge myself. This project is my personal mission to write code that stops this waste, ensuring that every joule of energy invested in farming results in a successful harvest and maximizing the energy efficiency of my nation's agriculture.

## What my project does
Kazi-Nyuki is my concept for an autonomous, solar-powered system that solves agricultural energy inefficiency. It works in three stages:

1.  Solar-Powered Scouting: An autonomous ground rover, powered by solar energy, patrols the farm using LiDAR and cameras to map the location and readiness of every single flower.
2.  AI-Powered Energy Optimization: This is where my "code" comes in. My AI concept analyzes the data from the scout and calculates the most energy-efficient path to pollinate only the viable flowers, preventing wasted resources.
3.  Targeted Action: A swarm of small, energy-efficient drones, also solar-powered, is dispatched to execute the AI's plan with precision.

The system effectively turns sunlight directly into increased crop yields, creating a closed-loop, hyper-efficient energy ecosystem on the farm.

## How I built it
As this is my idea-stage hackathon project, I "built" the comprehensive architectural blueprint and operational strategy myself.
1.  System Design: I designed the full hardware and software architecture.
2.  AI Model Conceptualization: I outlined the machine learning pipeline (CNN for image recognition, reinforcement learning for path optimization).
3.  Energy Flow Mapping: I mapped the entire energy lifecycle of the system to ensure it remains a net-positive energy solution.

## Challenges I ran into
The primary conceptual challenge I faced was drone energy autonomy. To solve this, I designed a system of "swarm intelligence" where my conceptual drones would communicate their battery levels and autonomously return to solar-charging pads while others take over their tasks.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am proud of developing a novel solution that reframes an agricultural problem as an energy challenge. On my own, I have designed a holistic, sustainable, and off-grid system that I believe has immense potential.

## What's next for Kazi-Nyuki
My next step is to secure seed funding to build the first physical prototype. I then aim to partner with a local university and agricultural estate to test and validate my AI models.
